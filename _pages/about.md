<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a PhD student at the Shanghai JiaoTong University, SoE, supervised by Prof. [Feng-Kuang Chiang](https://soe.sjtu.edu.cn/Web/FacultyDetail/20?t=60).

🤔 My research interests include AI+Education and LLM-based Agent. I keep collobration with my friends Dr. [Yanhao Jia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jQx7NpQAAAAJ&hl=en) on Multi-Modal Tasks, Dr. [Shuai Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=upbsFBAAAAAJ&hl=en) on LLMs-related Tasks. Specially, I aim to develop educational models to intelligentise education in China.


🤝 **Looking for collobration. If you are interested in working with me in AI tasks or AI4Edu tasks, please drop me an email.**
